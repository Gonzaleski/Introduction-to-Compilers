# Reversed Polish Notation Calculator

This repository contains a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator implemented in C using flex (lexical analyzer generator) and bison (parser generator).

## Usage

To run the project, you can either execute the provided executable file or follow these steps to compile it manually:

1. **Download the Files:**
   Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Compile the Code:**
   If you want to compile the code manually, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   # Step One: Generate the parser file
   bison -d rpcalc.y

   # Step Two: Generate the lexer file
   flex rpcalc.l

   # Step Three: Compile the parser and lexer files
   gcc rpcalc.tab.c lex.yy.c -o rpcalc
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   Once compiled, you can execute the program by running `./rpcalc` in your terminal.

## Accepted Inputs
   Accepted Inputs cover numbers and floating point numbers.__
   Accepted symbols include + (for sum), - (for subtract), * (for multipy), / (for division), n (for negative), ^ (for power), and sqrt (for squar root).
   Examples of accepted inputs:
   ```
   2 2 ^ n 8 + sqrt
   6 7 * 10 + n 30 -
   ```

## Outputs
   Outputs are numbers or floating point numbers.

## Files Included
